## 📝 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: What was the most challenging part?
**A**: "Coordinating animation timing across multiple state updates while maintaining smooth 60fps performance. I solved this by implementing a step-based history system using React hooks, allowing precise control over animation playback and state synchronization."

### Q: How did you ensure code quality?
**A**: "I established clear component patterns, used ESLint for code quality enforcement, maintained consistent naming conventions, and structured the codebase with separation of concerns - algorithm logic separate from visualization rendering. This made the code maintainable and scalable."

### Q: Why did you build this?
**A**: "I wanted to create a tool that bridges the gap between understanding algorithms theoretically and seeing how they work in practice. It's also valuable for technical interview preparation, which is something I'm passionate about helping others with."

### Q: How would you scale this?
**A**: "I'd implement lazy loading for algorithm pages, add server-side rendering for better SEO, introduce user accounts for progress tracking, and potentially add a backend API for custom algorithm challenges. The current component architecture already supports easy addition of new algorithms."

### Q: What would you do differently?
**A**: "I'd add TypeScript for type safety from the start, implement comprehensive unit tests with React Testing Library, and add more accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support. I'd also consider adding a collaborative mode for classroom use."
